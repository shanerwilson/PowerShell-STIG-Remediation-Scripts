üõ°Ô∏è PowerShell STIG Remediation Scripts


Automating Windows hardening and DISA STIG compliance with modular PowerShell scripts.

üìã About This Project
This repository contains PowerShell scripts designed to automate DISA STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide) compliance tasks for Windows environments.

Each script:

Focuses on one specific STIG requirement.

Is idempotent (safe to run multiple times).

Includes a clear .SYNOPSIS, .DESCRIPTION, and .NOTES block.

Is built for simplicity, clarity, and modularity.

üî• Project Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:

Provide easy-to-use scripts for cybersecurity students, blue teamers, system administrators, and security engineers.

Enable faster achievement of STIG compliance for Windows systems.

Build and demonstrate my expertise in system hardening using PowerShell automation.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
‚ö° Note: Always run PowerShell as Administrator to apply system-level changes.

Steps:
Clone this repository:

#git clone https://github.com/shanerwilson/PowerShell-STIG-Remediation-Scripts.git
