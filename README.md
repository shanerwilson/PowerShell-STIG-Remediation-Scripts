**Automating Windows hardening and DISA STIG compliance through modular PowerShell scripts.**

## üìã About This Project

Welcome to my collection of PowerShell scripts designed to automate **DISA STIG** (Security Technical Implementation Guide) compliance tasks for Windows environments.

Each script:
- Focuses on **one specific STIG requirement**.
- Is **idempotent** (safe to run multiple times).
- Includes a clear `.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, and `.NOTES` block.
- Is written with **simplicity**, **clarity**, and **modularity** in mind.

## üî• Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Provide **easy-to-use** scripts for cybersecurity students, blue teamers, system administrators, and security engineers.
- Help achieve **faster STIG compliance** for Windows systems.
- **Build and showcase** my experience in Windows security hardening using PowerShell automation.
